Here are some common issues you could create for an "issues-only" GitHub repository, especially relevant for DevOps-related projects:

### 1. **Environment Configuration Inconsistencies**
   - **Description:** There are discrepancies between development, staging, and production environments. For example, differences in package versions, environment variables, or system dependencies. This could lead to unexpected behavior when deploying code.
   - **Labels:** `bug`, `environment`, `urgent`

### 2. **Pipeline Optimization**
   - **Description:** The CI/CD pipeline is taking longer than expected. Analyze the pipeline for any inefficiencies or bottlenecks, such as unnecessary build steps, redundant tests, or non-optimized caching.
   - **Labels:** `enhancement`, `performance`, `CI/CD`

### 3. **Security Vulnerability in Dependencies**
   - **Description:** One or more dependencies have reported security vulnerabilities. Review and update these dependencies to the latest secure versions.
   - **Labels:** `security`, `dependencies`, `high-priority`

### 4. **Container Image Size Reduction**
   - **Description:** The Docker container images are larger than necessary, leading to longer build times and slower deployments. Identify opportunities to slim down the images by removing unnecessary files or dependencies.
   - **Labels:** `enhancement`, `docker`, `performance`

### 5. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Misconfiguration**
   - **Description:** There's a misconfiguration in the Terraform/Ansible/Kubernetes scripts that could lead to potential downtime or unexpected behavior in the infrastructure. Investigate and resolve the issue.
   - **Labels:** `bug`, `IaC`, `critical`

### 6. **Monitoring & Alerting Gaps**
   - **Description:** Current monitoring and alerting setup is missing some key metrics or is generating too many false positives. This could lead to unnoticed issues or alert fatigue. Review and enhance the monitoring configuration.
   - **Labels:** `enhancement`, `monitoring`, `DevOps`

### 7. **Automated Test Failures**
   - **Description:** Automated tests in the CI pipeline are failing intermittently, causing delays in the deployment process. Investigate the root cause of these failures and ensure test reliability.
   - **Labels:** `bug`, `testing`, `CI/CD`

### 8. **Load Balancer Misconfiguration**
   - **Description:** Load balancer settings might not be optimized, potentially leading to uneven distribution of traffic or slower response times under high load. Review and adjust the configuration as necessary.
   - **Labels:** `bug`, `load-balancer`, `network`

### 9. **Insufficient Documentation**
   - **Description:** Some key parts of the DevOps process, like deployment steps or troubleshooting guides, are not well documented. This could slow down onboarding for new team members or lead to mistakes.
   - **Labels:** `documentation`, `enhancement`

### 10. **Legacy System Integration Issues**
   - **Description:** Integration with a legacy system is causing issues, such as data inconsistencies or delays. Evaluate the integration strategy and suggest improvements or alternatives.
   - **Labels:** `bug`, `integration`, `legacy`

You can adjust the details and labels based on the specific needs of your project.
